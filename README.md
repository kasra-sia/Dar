# SDN Project with Dijkstra's Algorithm Routing

## Overview

This project implements an SDN (Software-Defined Networking) solution using Floodlight controller to find the best routing paths for communication between hosts in a network. It utilizes Dijkstra's algorithm for efficient routing decisions. The network consists of routers, hosts, and links with random delays.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure you have the following installed:

- Floodlight SDN controller
- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- python
## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/kasra-sia/sdn-routing-project.git
   cd sdn-routing-project
